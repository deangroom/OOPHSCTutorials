Message-passing is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects to communicate and collaborate. Here's how it works:

**1. Objects and Messages:**

Imagine objects as real-world entities like a car or a light switch. These objects have attributes (properties) and methods (functions that define their behavior). In message-passing, objects can send messages to other objects. These messages often:

* Request the receiving object to perform an action using its methods.
* Provide data or information needed by the receiving object.

**2. Mechanism of Message Passing:**

There are two main ways message-passing happens:

* **Method Calls:** This is the most common approach. When you call a method on an object, you're essentially sending a message to that object requesting it to execute that specific method. The method might process data, change the object's internal state, or even send messages to other objects.

**3. Example: Light Switch and Lamp**

Let's consider a simple example with a `LightSwitch` and a `Lamp` object:

```python
class LightSwitch:
  def __init__(self, lamp):
    self.lamp = lamp
    self.isOn = False

  def toggle(self):
    if self.isOn:
      self.lamp.turnOff()
      self.isOn = False
    else:
      self.lamp.turnOn()
      self.isOn = True

class Lamp:
  def __init__(self):
    self.isOn = False

  def turnOn(self):
    self.isOn = True
    print("Lamp is turned on")

  def turnOff(self):
    self.isOn = False
    print("Lamp is turned off")

# Create a lamp and a switch connected to it
lamp = Lamp()
switch = LightSwitch(lamp)

# Turn on the lamp using the switch (message passing)
switch.toggle()  # Output: Lamp is turned on

# Turn off the lamp using the switch
switch.toggle()  # Output: Lamp is turned off
```

In this example:

* The `LightSwitch` object has a `toggle` method.
* When you call `switch.toggle()`, you're sending a message to the `LightSwitch` object to execute its `toggle` method.
* The `toggle` method checks the current state of the switch (`isOn`) and sends a message (calls the method) to the `lamp` object to either `turnOn` or `turnOff`.
* The `Lamp` object responds to these messages by updating its internal state (`isOn`) and printing a message indicating its new state.

This is a basic illustration, but it demonstrates how objects can collaborate and influence each other's behavior through message-passing. Messages can be complex, carrying data and triggering more elaborate actions within the receiving object.
