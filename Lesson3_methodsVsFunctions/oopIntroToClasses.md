## Classes in Python: Object-Oriented Programming

Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that Python supports. They act as blueprints for creating objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Here's an overview and examples of using classes in Python:

**1. Defining a Class:**

You use the `class` keyword followed by the class name (conventionally starting with a capital letter) to define a class. Inside the class definition, you can:

- **Declare attributes:** These are variables that hold data specific to each object (instance) of the class.
- **Define methods:** These are functions that define the behavior of objects. They typically operate on the object's attributes (using `self` as the first argument).

**Example:**

```python
class Dog:
  """A simple Dog class"""

  def __init__(self, name, breed):  # Special method for initialization
    self.name = name
    self.breed = breed

  def bark(self):  # A method to define barking behavior
    print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Create objects (instances) of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Labrador")
friend_dog = Dog("Charlie", "Poodle")
```

**2. Creating Objects (Instances):**

The `class` defines the blueprint, but you create actual objects (instances) using the class name with parentheses. These instances hold their own set of attributes defined in the class.

- In the example, `my_dog` and `friend_dog` are objects (instances) of the `Dog` class.

**3. Initialising Objects (using `__init__`):**

- The `__init__()` method (also called the constructor) is a special method that gets called automatically whenever you create a new object of the class. It's used to initialize the object's attributes with values.
- In the `Dog` class example, `__init__()` takes two arguments (`name` and `breed`) and assigns them to the object's attributes (`self.name` and `self.breed`).

**4. Accessing Attributes and Methods:**

- You access object attributes using dot notation (`object_name.attribute_name`).
- You call object methods by following the same dot notation, treating them like functions (`object_name.method_name()`).

**Example:**

```python
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(friend_dog.breed)  # Output: Poodle
```

**5. Benefits of Classes:**

- **Code organisation:** Classes group related data and functionality together, making code more readable and maintainable.
- **Reusability:** You can create a class once and use it to create multiple objects, promoting code reuse.
- **Encapsulation:** Classes can control access to attributes and methods, promoting data protection and preventing unintended modifications.

**Example: Enhancing the Dog Class:**

```python
class Dog:
  """A Dog class with setters and getters"""

  def __init__(self, name, breed):
    self.name = name
    self._age = 0  # Using an underscore for private attribute

  def set_age(self, age):
    if age >= 0:
      self._age = age
    else:
      print("Age cannot be negative")

  def get_age(self):
    return self._age

  def bark(self):
    print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Create a dog object
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Labrador")

# Set and get age using methods (encapsulation)
my_dog.set_age(2)
print(f"{my_dog.name} is {my_dog.get_age()} years old.")
```

This example demonstrates adding methods for setting and getting the dog's age (`set_age` and `get_age`), showing how classes can encapsulate data and control access.

By understanding and using classes, you can structure your Python programs in a more organized, reusable, and maintainable way.
