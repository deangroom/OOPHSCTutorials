This Python script uses the **tkinter library** to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to select a dog breed and its sub-breed from dropdown menus. The data for the breeds and sub-breeds is **loaded from a JSON fil**e.

The **DogBreed class** is defined with two attributes: **breed and sub_breeds.** These attributes are set in the constructor method (__init__), which is called when a new DogBreed object is created.

The load_data function opens the dogs.json file and loads the JSON data into a Python dictionary. It then iterates over the items in the message field of the dictionary, creating a DogBreed object for each item and appending it to the dog_breeds list.

**The update_sub_breeds function is called when a breed is selected from the breed combobox in the GUI**. It updates the sub-breed combobox with the sub-breeds of the selected breed. I**f the selected breed has no sub-breeds, the sub-breed combobox is cleared.
**
**The main function is the entry point of the script.** 
1. It first calls load_data to load the dog breed data. 
2. It then creates the main window of the GUI and the breed and sub-breed labels and comboboxes. 
3. The breed combobox is populated with the breeds from the dog_breeds list. 
4. The update_sub_breeds function is bound to the breed combobox, so it is called whenever a breed is selected. 
5. The update_sub_breeds function is also called once initially to populate the sub-breed combobox based on the first breed in the breed combobox. 
6. Finally, the mainloop method is called on the main window to start the GUI event loop.

The script is executed from the command line or another Python script, the main function is called because of the if __name__ == "__main__": line. This line checks if the script is being run directly (rather than being imported as a module), and if so, it calls the main function.
