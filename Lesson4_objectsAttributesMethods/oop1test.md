# Tutorial 6: Using the Unittest library to test the code

The script begins by importing the unittest module and the Car class from the oop1 module. The unittest module is a built-in Python module for testing Python code. The Car class is the class that will be tested.

Next, a test case for the Car class is defined by creating a new class TestCar that inherits from unittest.TestCase. Inheriting from unittest.TestCase means that the TestCar class is a test case and it can use all the methods and assertions provided by the unittest.TestCase class.

The setUp method is a special method that is called before each test method is executed. In this method, a Car object is created and assigned to self.car. This object will be used in the test methods.

The test_attributes method tests the attributes of the Car object. It uses the assertEqual method to check that the brand, model, and color attributes of the Car object are correctly set.

The test_drive method tests the drive method of the Car object. It uses the assertEqual method to check that the drive method returns the correct string.

The test_modify_color method tests that the color attribute of the Car object can be modified. It first modifies the color attribute of the Car object, and then uses the assertEqual method to check that the color attribute has been correctly modified.

Finally, the script checks if it is being run as the main module, and if so, it calls unittest.main(). This function runs all the test methods in the test case. If the script is being imported as a module, the test case will not be run. This allows the test case to be used in other scripts or modules if needed.
