# Object Orientated Programming
## Intermediate level Python


### from the HSC Syllabus 2022

This unit extends the understanding of basic programming structures into the Object-Oriented Paradigm (OOP). Key concepts such as objects, classes, inheritance and polymorphism will be explored. The application of these key concepts and others will be used to create, test and modify OOP-based software solutions. **The use of version control and backup systems should also be employed for all projects**

This would imply the use of GIT (although the extent to which GIT is explored has not been eluded to in the syllabus)

The indicated time for this is 10 weeks (approx 30 hours) and this includes some form of an assessment task.

This is a 10 week unit of work.
