# Object classification

## HSC Syllabus explaination

Classifying data using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python involves creating classes that represent the classifier and the data you want to classify.

Pending more information (March,2024) from NESA, it would seem very unlikely students would be expected to 'create' this in an examination.

Here's a breakdown of the concept with an example using email classification:

1. Classifier Class:

- This class defines the blueprint for different classifiers you might create.
- It can store information like the possible classification labels.
- An important method in this class is classify(data). 
- This method takes the data to be classified as input and returns the predicted classification label. 
- However, the implementation of this method depends on the specific type of classifier being created, so we define it as NotImplementedError here.

```
class Classifier:
  def __init__(self, classes):
    self.classes = classes

  def classify(self, data):
    raise NotImplementedError

```

## An example

### EmailClassifier:

This class inherits from the Classifier class and is specific to classifying emails as spam or not spam.
It defines its own classify(data) method that takes an email (as a string) as input.
This method splits the email into words and checks for keywords that are indicative of spam emails.
If a spam keyword is found, it returns the "spam" label. Otherwise, it returns the "not spam" label.

```
class EmailClassifier(Classifier):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__(["spam", "not spam"])

  def classify(self, email):
    # Split the email into words
    words = email.split()

    # Check for keywords that indicate spam
    spam_keywords = ["free", "Rick Astley", "casino"]
    for word in spam_keywords:
      if word in words:
        return self.classes[0]  # spam

    # Otherwise, classify as not spam
    return self.classes[1]  # not spam

```

## Classification in Machine Learning

In Python, 'classification' is also associated with machine learning.

In this case, classification  refers to using code to identify and categorise **objects within an image or data set.** This is a core concept in computer vision and has applications like self-driving cars, image recognition software, and even medical analysis.

There are two main approaches to object classification in Python:

1. **Machine Learning with Libraries like scikit-learn:**

   This approach involves training a model on a large dataset of labeled images. Each image has a corresponding label indicating the object it contains (e.g., "cat," "dog," "car"). The model learns to identify patterns and features within the images that differentiate between these objects.

   Here's a simplified example using scikit-learn:

   ```python
   from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.svm import SVC

   # Load the Iris flower dataset (already labeled)
   iris = load_iris()
   X = iris.data  # Features (measurements of the flowers)
   y = iris.target  # Labels (type of flower)

   # Split data into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

   # Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
   clf = SVC()
   clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

   # Use the trained model to predict the class of a new flower
   new_flower = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]  # Features of a new flower
   predicted_class = clf.predict(new_flower)

   # Show the predicted class
   print("Predicted flower type:", iris.target_names[predicted_class[0]])
   ```

   This code trains an SVM classifier on the Iris flower dataset and then uses it to predict the type of a new flower based on its features.

2. **Deep Learning with Frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch:**

   This approach utilizes deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are highly effective for image recognition. CNNs automatically learn features from the images during the training process.

   Deep learning requires more complex code and computational resources but offers higher accuracy for complex object classification tasks.

Both approaches have their advantages. Machine learning with scikit-learn is a good starting point for simpler tasks, while deep learning offers more power for complex image recognition.
