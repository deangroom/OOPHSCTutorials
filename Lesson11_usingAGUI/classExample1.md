This is a Python script that defines a class Song and creates an instance of it. The Song class is designed to represent a song on Spotify.

The Song class has a constructor method __init__ that takes four parameters: title, artist, album, and length. These parameters represent the title of the song, the artist who performed the song, the album the song is from, and the length of the song, respectively. Inside the constructor, these parameters are assigned to instance variables self.title, self.artist, self.album, and self.length. The self keyword refers to the instance of the class, allowing us to store these parameters as attributes of the instance.

The Song class also has a method printSong that prints the details of the song to the console. It does this by printing the values of the instance variables self.title, self.artist, self.album, and self.length.

After the Song class is defined, the script creates an instance of the class with the title "Cruel Summer", the artist "Taylor Swift", the album "1989", and the length "3:16". This instance is stored in the variable song1.

Finally, the script calls the printSong method on the song1 instance. 

This prints the details of the song to the console.
